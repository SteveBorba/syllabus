#Software & Tools
In this course we will be using several online services and software packages. In order to particpate in the class you will need to have operational, up-to-date accounts and installations of these tools.

###Software

###Online Services

####Slack
Slack is an online team collaboration tool. Our [LADS-EDU Slack space](https://ladsedu.slack.com) will be the hub for our communication and the go-to place for discussing the readings and connecting with classmates when you have technical problems. Use this [invitation link](https://ladsedu.slack.com/shared_invite/MTMyMzAwMTI0NzkwLTE0ODUyNTQyOTktYjRmOTg2MDhmYQ) to join our Slack team.

####Github
GitHub is an online repository using the Git version control system. Our [LADS-EDU Github space](https://github.com/learninganalytics-datascience-edu) is where I will upload course documents, links to readings and assignments. It is also where you will submit your completed assignments. You will need to [create a (free) personal Github account](https://github.com/join?source=header) if you don't have one already. When you have a Github account, share your username in the #githubdeets Slack channel and I will add you to our class organization so you will have full access to all the files and I will be able to see when you have work ready for me to review.

###Software
