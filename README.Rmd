### Overview

Advances in computing, internet, and sensing technologies are changing our relationship to data in all areas of life, including education and learning. Large quantities of detailed information is now routinely collected as part of our interaction with digital learning tools and social media, and tools for data collection in physical spaces are rapidly becoming more affordable and less intrusive. This creates exciting opportunities to generate insight that can help us better understand and improve learning, but it also raises questions about data rights, validity issues for different data-based inferences, and more broadly concerns about what the utilization of this data may mean for education and society. Importantly, the increasing prevalence and pervasiveness of data means that in the near future, critically assessing and making informed decisions about data use will be part of every education-related career.

Learning Analytics & Data Science in Education provides an introduction to uses of data in education that will help students develop their ability to evaluate data sources, perform analyses and critically evaluate applications of data use in real world educational situations. The course weaves together three strands of focus: a conceptual concern with selecting and interpreting data-based information, a technical emphasis on working with data and performing analyses, and a societal lens on understanding the opportunities, challenges and concerns that such data use presents. There are no pre-requisites for this course and no previous experience in statistics, computer science or data manipulation is expected; however, students will be introduced to and asked to work with a selected set of data analysis tools and techniques during the course.

Specific topics covered will include a subset of: data types and sources, data cleaning and organization methods, exploration and visualization approaches, network analysis, structure discovery, classification techniques, text mining, prediction modeling, dashboards, analytic sense-making, data-informed decision-taking, analytics implementation design, institutional factors, data ethics and policy issues.

###Course Goals
The overarching goal of this course is for students to acquire the knowledge and skills to be intelligent producers and consumers of learning analytics and data science in education. By the end of the course students will be able to:

*Systematically select, analyze and interpret data to make an argument about learning
*Take an informed position on research, policy, and practice issues related to educational data science 

This necessarily means that students become comfortable with the educational applications of three domain areas: computer science, statistics and the context surrounding data use. There is no expectation for students to become experts in any single area. Rather the course will enhance student competency in identifying issues at the level of data acquisition, data analysis and application of analysis in education.

###Course Requirements
Assignment|Description|Weight
----------|----------------------------|------
Online & In-Class Engagement	| This includes active and prepared participation: during in-class sessions; in online exchanges about the readings; as part of the class community in asking and answering questions about data, analysis and interpretation. |	20%
Individual Data Science Assignments (5) |	Using provided tools and/or code, conduct and interpret the results of various data processing and analyses approaches (e.g. data cleaning, dimension reduction, clustering, predictive modelling, social network analysis, natural language processing). |	50%
Group Data Science Project	| Design, conduct and interpret an analysis designed to produce a particular kind of insight into specific data. |	30%

###Online Space & Communication
We will have two online spaces for this course. The first is in GitHub, an online version control repository system (<https://github.com/learninganalytics-datascience-edu>). This is where I will upload course documents, links to readings and assignments. It is also where you will submit your completed assignments. You will need to create a (free) GitHub account and then I will add you to our class organization so you will have access to all the files. The second space is in Slack, an online team collaboration tool (<https://ladsedu.slack.com>). This will be the hub for our communication and the go to place for discussing the readings and connecting with classmates when you have technical problems. Finally, you should also make sure that you have a working NYU Home email account (which you check regularly).

###Readings
Course readings come from a variety of scholarly journals and edited book volumes. The majority of these are available online through the NYU library accessed via NYU Home and you are welcome to work with them in digital or print form as you wish. Exceptions are noted on the week-by-week schedule. A small number of readings not available digitally will be distributed in class. 
###Software
You will be asked to download, install and use a number of data analysis tools as part of your work in this course. All required tools are freely available on the web and are supported by communities of users which generate documentation, offer tutorials, and ask and answer questions to help each other.

###Accessibility
Any student attending NYU who needs an accommodation due to a chronic, psychological, visual, mobility and/or learning disability, or is Deaf or Hard of Hearing should register with the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities, 719 Broadway, 2nd Floor, 212.998.4980 (telephone and TTY), (<http://www.nyu.edu/csd>)
